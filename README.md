# Raycasting C
A simple game to study raycasting using C and SDL 2.

### Raycasting Programming with C
This project is the second part of [Professor Gustavo Pezzi's (Pikuma)](https://pikuma.com/about) course, [Raycasting Programming with C](https://courses.pikuma.com/courses/raycasting-c). Using the [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) library to facilitate the design of geometric shapes and the [game loop](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2167437&seqNum=2), we can focus on the [raycasting algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA).
The objective of this project was to deep into the mathematical concepts behind the [raycasting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) used in the game [Wolfenstein (1992)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), such as calculations of distances, height of walls, character and field of view using [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry).
